## Simple Calculator
This is a basic calculator project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## Features
Basic Math Operations: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
AC Button: Clears everything from the display.
Delete Button (DE): Deletes the last number or operator.
Decimal (.): Allows entering decimal numbers.
Equal Button: Shows the result of the calculation.
## What I Used
HTML: Used for the structure of the calculator.
CSS: Used to style the calculator and make it look nice.
JavaScript: Used to make the calculator work when buttons are clicked.
## How It Works
There are buttons for numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /).
When you click a button, the value appears in the input field (called "display").
The AC button clears everything in the display.
The DE button deletes the last character you entered.
The Equal button uses the eval() function in JavaScript to calculate and show the result.
